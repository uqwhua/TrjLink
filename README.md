# TrjLink

Source code for ICDE 2019 paper: [Moving Object Linking Based on Historical Trace](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8731507) and TKDE 2020 paper: [Trajectory-Based Spatiotemporal Entity Linking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9250637)

## Problem Description
Given two sets of moving objects with their historical traces (one as data, the other as query), we expect to find the top-k candidates for each object in the query set, which are highly possible to be the same individual in real life.

## Dataset
T-Drive is a publicly available dataset and can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/).
A small subset of T-Drive is provided in this project for testing.

## Project Structure
    Testing/                                  
    ├── RoadNetworkInfo/NNid2lnglat.csv        -- the road network information used for simple map-matching as the data preprosseing
    ├── TestData-tdrive/                       -- T-Drive dataset including 600 objects' one-week trajectory
                                                  Note that some objects could be discarded due to too few data points
